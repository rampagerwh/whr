## How to update repository

1. Update local content (typically BattleScribe URL or files manually). For this step make sure to have all the files (.cat and .gst) decompressed under `data` folder
2. Run `rename.py` script to replace accents and spaces for BattleScribe to understand the files syntax
3. Commit changes on `main`
4. Add next tag with release message
